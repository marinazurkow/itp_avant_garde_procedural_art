### assignment 01

the role of chance in one work by one dada or surrealist artist: i chose artist [kurt schwitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Schwitters)' [simultangedicht kaa gee dee](http://ubu.com/sound/dada.html) sound piece.

questions:
* what was the artist's motivation or intention?

i couldn't find any information directly from the artist, but i think a clue stands in the title of the piece, simultangedicht, which stands for simultaneous poem. my guess is that the artist used these made-up words and sounds in unison and clashing with each other, in order to mimic stream of consciousness, with repeated variations of patterns, a certain rhythm and emphasis, which resembles a lot free-form thinking.

* did others in the movement employ similar strategies? what did they hope to effect?

fellow surrealist artists also used stream of consciousness as inspiration, which is reflected in the dream-like sequences of salvador dalí and even in his collaboration with luis buñuel, un chien andalou, which is a landmark in modern art and which resonates in several spheres, such as the influence it had on late 1980's band pixies, who based their song debaser, first track on their second album, on this surrealist film.

i think that these works try to break with art tradition and try to explore the rich imagery of dreams and the possibilities that randomness and non-linearity provide. they hope to convey feelings that are hard to describe, by bypassing reason and appealing directly to the subconscious.

* what was the context for the work? what was happening historically?

this work was done in early 1920's, right after the end of world war i, which was a time where reason had justified these massive war between supposedly civilized cultures, so that nothing made much sense anymore and it was a failure of the modern world.
